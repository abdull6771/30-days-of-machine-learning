# 30 Days of Machine Learning ðŸš€

Welcome to the **30 Days of Machine Learning** project!  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through 30 days of hands-on machine learning projects, designed to take you from beginner to intermediate level.

Each day focuses on a specific ML concept, technique, or project, building your skills progressively.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is structured as a 30-day challenge, where each day introduces a new machine learning task. The notebook includes:

- **Markdown Cells**: Detailed instructions, objectives, suggested datasets, and resources for each day.  
- **Code Cells**: Placeholder code cells with comments for most tasks, with a fully implemented example for **Day 3 (Linear Regression)**.  
- **Topics Covered**:  
  Data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, NLP, reinforcement learning, model deployment, and more.
